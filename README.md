Hello, my name is Geovanne
This repository will briefly tell you all about my career and my next steps, objectives, plans and so on.
At the age of 15, I started my work routine through FIA (Fundação Infância Adolescência) as an apprentice at CRORJ (Centro Regional Odontológico do Rio de Janeiro) 
and after that I worked for a few more companies, mainly in the administrative area.
It wasn't until 2020 that I had my first contact with programming at UFRJ during my Bachelor's degree in Physics.
However, it wasn't until 2023 that I knew for sure that my field was Technology. 
Since then, I've dedicated myself to increasing my ability to solve algorithmic problems through exercises
I've been training through the courses offered by Alura and the DevSamurai community.
